accuracy on the following dataset.<br/>
Airline Tickets<br/>
o The project delivery <br/>

The project implementation will include the following <br/>
 Apply the most suitable data wrangling methods. <br/>
 Apply Data visualization charts to observe more knowledge about your 
dataset<br/>
 Apply a regression algorithm using gradient descent algorithm or any 
regression algorithm. <br/>
 Tune model parameters to get high accuracy
Project deliverables <br/>
 Dataset(.csv file) <br/>
 Code files( python file) <br/>
 Presentation including short description of your dataset, data <br/> 
preprocessing, visualization and your selected model with screenshots for 
each.
